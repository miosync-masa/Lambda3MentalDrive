[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13fnG8PtTiqTO9fep7F_gypE0iwQYeV0-?usp=sharing)

A mathematical framework for psychological dynamics assessment based on Lambda³ (Λ³) Theory, integrating Jungian cognitive functions with tensor mathematics and physics-inspired models.

## Overview

This system provides a comprehensive psychological assessment tool that goes beyond traditional scoring methods by incorporating:

- **Regime Viscosity Tensors**: Quantifying the "stickiness" of psychological states
- **Attractor Basin Analysis**: Identifying psychological patterns and their stability
- **Multi-domain Social Tensors**: Analyzing social functioning across different life domains
- **Pulsation Dynamics**: Modeling emotional events as physical phenomena

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic State Modeling
- Real-time tracking of psychological states using tensor mathematics
- Non-time-dependent transaction-based changes (Λ³ theory core principle)
- PATH (Jungian function) interaction matrices

### 2. Viscosity Analysis
- Quantifies how "stuck" someone is in their current state
- Identifies high-viscosity patterns (e.g., rumination loops, shadow dominance)
- Provides targeted intervention strategies based on viscosity reduction

### 3. Multi-dimensional Assessment
- Integrates MBTI cognitive functions (Ni, Ne, Ti, Te, Fi, Fe, Si, Se)
- Tracks self-aspects: core, ideal, social, and shadow
- Analyzes social functioning across work, family, friends, and online domains

### 4. Advanced Analytics
- Manifold analysis with Riemannian geometry
- Attractor basin dynamics with escape difficulty calculations
- Cross-domain pattern recognition
